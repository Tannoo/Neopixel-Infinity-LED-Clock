# Neopixel-Infinity-LED-Clock
An Infinity mirror clock I created using 60 neopixels in a strip.

This clock is using an Adafruit Feather ESP8266 breakout and a DS1307RTC.

I am planning on installing an "atomic" mechanical click in the center. I am still working on getting that coded to operate it in sync with the LEDs.
That might just be another clock because I like this one.
