# Neopixel-Infinity-LED-Clock
An Infinity mirror clock I created using 60 neopixels in a strip.

This clock is using an Adafruit Feather ESP8266 breakout and a DS1307RTC.

# Features:

    Very quiet operation.
    Chimes via pulsing the entire strip. No sound.
    RTC for accurate time-keeping ability.
    NTP sync'ed time for the RTC.
    Outside temperature via Weather update from openweathermap.org for the the background color.
